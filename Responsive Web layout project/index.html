            <p>Tokyo, originally a small fishing village known as Edo, has a rich history that spans centuries. The name Tokyo, meaning "Eastern Capital," was adopted in 1868 when the emperor moved his residence there, marking the end of the shogunate and the start of modernization. Today, Tokyo serves as Japan's capital and is the country's most populous metropolitan area, functioning as both a city and a prefecture with unique administrative status.</p>
<br>
<p>Edo's importance began to rise in the late 12th century, becoming a key regional base during the Kamakura period. In 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu established it as the seat of his shogunate, which governed Japan for over 250 years. During this time, Edo flourished, becoming one of the world's largest cities. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, it was renamed Tokyo and underwent rapid industrialization and expansion. Today, Tokyo is a global hub of culture, technology, and finance.</p>
