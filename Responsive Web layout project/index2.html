                <p> Paris is an ancient city, first known by its Celtic name Lutetia. By the first century BC, it was a settlement of the Parisii tribe, who lent their name to the city. The Latinised name Parisius became the basis for the modern name. Today, Paris is both a city and a d√©partement, making it one of France's smallest administrative divisions by area.</p>
<br>
<p>Although human habitation in the region dates back to prehistoric times, the first significant settlement emerged under Roman control around 52 BC, following Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul. Lutetia expanded steadily, developing into a prosperous Gallo-Roman city by the third century AD. By the late fourth century, it became a key religious and political center, ultimately evolving into the capital of medieval and modern France.
